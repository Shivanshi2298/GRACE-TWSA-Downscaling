# GRACE-TWSA-Downscaling
In this project, we utilized the Random Forest regression machine learning algorithm to downscale GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data from a 1-degree resolution to a finer 0.25-degree resolution for Mahanadi Basin. Various hydrological and topographical parameters including canopy water storage, precipitation, soil moisture, surface runoff, evapotranspiration, DEM (Digital Elevation Model), slope, and aspect were incorporated into the model.
All the parameters were pre-processed such as resampled into 1-degree/ 0.25-degree, unit was converted to cm, and converted to anomaly by subtracting the baseline mean same as that of GRACE TWSA (Jan 2004 to Dec 2009).
The model encompassed data spanning from April 2002 to June 2017. Initially, the model was trained on coarse-resolution data (1-degree), while high-resolution parameter data (0.25-degree) was employed for predicting the high-resolution GRACE TWSA (downscaled TWSA).
Additionally, we predicted GRACE TWSA at the 1-degree resolution, which served as a residual. This residual was later added to the final 0.25-degree TWSA to minimize errors in the downscaling process.
